## Kyrgyz Republic: Developing and Piloting of New Audit Methodology for Electronic Public Tenders

### Description:


### Project timeline:

2018-2019

### Project status:
Fully deployed

## Problem statement
Several countries including the Kyrgyz Republic in the EBRD region have introduced eProcurement as part of their public procurement and anti-corruption reform agendas. The introduction of eProcurement requires revision to the approach to monitoring and audit of procurement procedures, to fit new regulatory structures and legal and institutional frameworks incorporated in the eProcurement system.

Auditing procurement procedures conducted electronically requires a distinctly different approach from auditing manual, paper-based public procurement process, so the following list of tasks was formulated in order to meet the purposes of the assignment:
- A data-driven audit methodology based on indicators must be established;
- A standard for automatic electronic data collection from eProcurement systems used for transactions needs to be developed;
- After the extraction of the appropriate transaction data from the eProcurement system/s auditors should be provided with access to IT tools that support data processing and compliance and performance analysis;
- Auditors need to be trained to work with the data-driven audit process, to execute their tasks accurately when using the new methodology, tools and procedures.

Therefore, introducing audit procedures for eProcurement tenders requires a careful analysis of the special characteristics of eProcurement procedures that may have an impact on audit procedures, followed by the development of special standards and a designated methodology that takes into consideration the particular features of electronic public procurement tenders.

Several mainly Latin American countries have successfully developed and implemented eProcurement audit.  However as EBRD countries have no direct access to their international best practice and experience, a Technical Cooperation (TC) project was developed by the EBRD to **design a new audit methodology** for digitally conducted public procurements that is suitable for EBRD countries, to **develop online tools for auditors** to implement this methodology and to **pilot the methodology and IT tools in selected EBRD countries of operations**, the first one being the Kyrgyz Republic.
