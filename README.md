## Kyrgyz Republic: Developing and Piloting of New Audit Methodology for Electronic Public Tenders

### Description:
A model data-driven and risk-based eProcurement audit methodology is developed based on the best practices from the experience of Latin America countries, the model methodology is adopted and piloted, a risk engine and data analytics modules are developed in the pilot project.

### Project timeline:

2018-2019

### Project status:
Fully deployed

## Context and problem statement
Several countries including the Kyrgyz Republic in the EBRD region have introduced eProcurement as part of their public procurement and anti-corruption reform agendas. The introduction of eProcurement requires revision to the approach to monitoring and audit of procurement procedures, to fit new regulatory structures and legal and institutional frameworks incorporated in the eProcurement system.

Auditing procurement procedures conducted electronically requires a distinctly different approach from auditing manual, paper-based public procurement process, so the following list of tasks was formulated in order to meet the purposes of the assignment:
- A data-driven audit methodology based on indicators must be established;
- A standard for automatic electronic data collection from eProcurement systems used for transactions needs to be developed;
- After the extraction of the appropriate transaction data from the eProcurement system/s auditors should be provided with access to IT tools that support data processing and compliance and performance analysis;
- Auditors need to be trained to work with the data-driven audit process, to execute their tasks accurately when using the new methodology, tools and procedures.

Therefore, introducing audit procedures for eProcurement tenders requires a careful analysis of the special characteristics of eProcurement procedures that may have an impact on audit procedures, followed by the development of special standards and a designated methodology that takes into consideration the particular features of electronic public procurement tenders.

Several mainly Latin American countries have successfully developed and implemented eProcurement audit.  However as EBRD countries have no direct access to their international best practice and experience, a Technical Cooperation (TC) project was developed by the EBRD to **design a new audit methodology** for digitally conducted public procurements that is suitable for EBRD countries, to **develop online tools for auditors** to implement this methodology and to **pilot the methodology and IT tools in selected EBRD countries of operations**, the first one being the Kyrgyz Republic. 

## Objectives and vision
The EBRD TC aimed, together with the Kyrgyz Republic Chamber of Accounts (KR CA), to: 
-	Design a new model audit methodology for digital public procurement based on OECD guidance and international best practice, and 
-	Enable data-driven audit of public procurement in the Kyrgyz Republic through a pilot of the new audit methodology with the KR CA.

The EBRD-developed vision to achieve these objectives included the following:
-	To identify modern audit best practice for electronically conducted procurement;
-	Develop standards for auditing public procurement conducted electronically and a model methodology for auditing electronic procurement procedures;
-	Develop a localised version of the model methodology for the KR CA public procurement audit.;
-	Deployment of an OCDS-based set of analytical online tools for auditors to enable an analysis of public procurement data for audit purposes and to pilot the methodology.

Other requirements include: the extraction and then transformation of data **from the existing digital procurement platforms**. Other open government data sources can support more precise analysis. A similar project can be implemented in other jurisdictions building on a wide range (in terms of quality and types of data) of digital procurement platforms and open government data sources. 
In addition, to ensure that the **set of risk indicator is targeting the significant risks in public procurement**, clear risk management frameworks, strategies and implementation plans according to relevant international standards should be in place.  

## Technological solution and implementation

## Results and future expectations
As a result of the project, the **new audit methodology** for electronic public tenders **was developed and piloted**. The Kyrgyz Republic Chamber of Accounts now has a data-driven audit methodology and the public procurement data analytical infrastructure to support their audits. The methodology and the analytical tools enable a previously impossible level of risk analysis of procurement spending within the country and at various stages of the digital procurements, audit cycle and the eProcurement audit methodology are ready to be implemented in other EBRD countries.

In terms of the goals set for the project, the new audit methodology and analytical tool:
-	Provide a direction for data analytics application during the digital public procurement audit based on [OECD](https://www.oecd.org) guidance and international best practice;
-	Enable the state audit institution to conduct the data-driven audit of public procurement transactions.

Deployment of an [OCDS](https://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/)-based set of online analytical tools for auditors enables methodology piloting and analysis of public procurement data for audit purposes through:
-	Providing a risk assessment of the digital procurement transactions in the system – by applying risk-indicators algorithms results calculated by the risk-engine;
-	Providing a risk assessment of the contracting authorities using the system – by aggregating procurement transactions risk-indicators results in line with the designated methodology;
-	Enabling the automated generation of auditors’ checklist – the functionality enables adjustment of the checklist for each audit and its’ objectives;
-	Providing support for audit results evaluation by applying scoring functionality – auditors can use the automated scoring to evaluate audit results gathered in a checklist and support their conclusions. 

Going forward, the impact of the project could be increased by allocating resources and a budget to support the analytical capacity of the auditors to develop a new analytical hypothesis on risk identification and implement them into the digital environment.  The tools and risk indicators now available require a periodic evaluation and need to be assessed for their relevance and effectiveness in a constantly changing environment. The risk information could be used to develop risk responses not just for audit purposes but for policymakers in their decisions across different policy fields.

## Impact
- Enables public procurement policymakers to make **data-driven decisions**; 
- Provides for the **automated generation of public procurement reports**; 
- Ensures **transparency of public spending**.

## Leasons learnt
The main challenges for the project were related to securing the necessary support from the people and organisations to access the required systems, data, policies and regulations. It took some time to agree on the design of the risk indicators before their development and deployment. Significant time was spent in getting interim feedback from the key beneficiaries on project milestones achieved and managing their expectations on the projects interim results. This can be partially explained by the fact that this is a new concept, and the change management should be considered as part of future projects.

As a separate point, the design approach assumes the risk management framework is developed and employed for assessment, prevention and mitigation of risks throughout the public procurement cycle. This is not the case for the Kyrgyz Republic procurement sector. The Kyrgyz Republic procurement sector is missing clear risk management frameworks, strategies and implementation plans according to relevant international standards. The risk indicators are supposed to be an integral part of the comprehensive risk management framework; however, for this Project, they were developed outside of this framework as the risk management framework is not implemented for the public procurement system in the Kyrgyz Republic.

Lessons that can be taken from the project include:
- **The underlying risk management concept is a key determinant of success of the implementation of the model methodology** – impacting the ability of the users to identify, assess and respond to the risks with the audit by designing and applying appropriate risk-based data analytics and tools; 
- **Projects should be implemented in several phases**, giving an opportunity for the users of the model methodology to move up through the analytics maturity levels naturally and consistently while providing them with support to grow their capacity at each level; 
- **A budget for training and outreach should be included** to ensure take-up, proper use and continuous development of the methodology and tools, 
- **The quality and reliability of data is critical** for the tools that are developed to be able to support auditors in their work - a lack of a data source and the poor quality of data create major challenges for the implementation of the methodology. It increases the resources needed and pushes the project costs up and reduces the accuracy and reliability of the analytical tools available to the auditors.  As a result there is a significant risk that the auditor’s trust in the tools that are developed can be seriously undermined.
